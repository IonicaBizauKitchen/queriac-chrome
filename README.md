Queriac Chrome Extension
========================

This is the source code for the Queriac Chrome Extension, which is 
hosted on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mbinhgdjnejaecocmffcfajgjmcnddik)

This extension does one thing: It overrides Chrome's "New Tab" page, 
giving you a context from which you can execute queriac commands. 
The reason for this is that you can't execute javascript from 
Google's default "New Tab" page.
